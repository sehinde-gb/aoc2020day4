- Day 4: Passport Processing


## Description

- You arrive at the airport only to realize that you grabbed your North Pole Credentials instead of your passport. 
- While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.

It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.
